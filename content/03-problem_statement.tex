\section{Problem statement}

According to Statista \cite{statista2025social}, YouTube is the second most used social network globally, only behind Facebook, with $2,530$ million active monthly users. Notably, 35\% of U.S. adults regularly get news from this video-focused platform \parencite{pewresearch2025social}. These facts highlight how important it is to do any kind of analysis.

Although enterprise social-listening suites (like {Talkwalker}\footnote{\url{https://www.talkwalker.com}} and {Meltwater}\footnote{\url{https://www.meltwater.com}}) and social science research tools (like {Communalytic}\footnote{\url{https://communalytic.org}}) monitor YouTube, their pipelines and models are proprietary, limiting methodological transparency, reproducibility, and academic scrutiny for topic-level studies. This proprietary approach contradicts with the principles of \textbf{transparent and reproducible science}.

\textbf{Academic researchers} often lack a verifiable system that automates collection, cleaning, descriptive analytics, and insight generation while exposing schemas for independent replication.

Currently, researchers face a significant technical barrier: they must either rely on these proprietary \enquote{black-box} tools or invest considerable time building complex data collection systems from scratch. There is a gap for an application that provides a transparent, documented, and reproducible foundation for YouTube data collection, specifically for users who do not want to deal with the complexities of the API directly.
