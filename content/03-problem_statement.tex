\section{Problem statement}


According to Statista \cite{statista2025social}, YouTube is the second most used social network globally, only behind Facebook, with $2,530$ million active monthly users. Notably, 35\% of U.S. adults regularly get news from this video-focused platform \cite{pewresearch2025social}. These facts highlight how important it is to do any kind of analysis.

Although enterprise social-listening (like Talkwalker, Meltwater or Communalytic) suites monitor YouTube their pipelines and models are proprietary, limiting methodological transparency, reproducibility, and academic scrutiny for topic-level studies. This proprietary approach is fundamentally at odds with the principles of \textbf{open science}, which prioritize shared knowledge and verifiable research.

In academic researches often lack a verifiable system that automates collection, cleaning, descriptive analytics, and insight generation (sentiment, topics and networks) while exposing code and schemas for independent replication.

Currently there is not a free and open-source application that collets YouTube video and collect data, standardizes them into auditable data structure, computes baseline engagement metrics and applies transparent NLP methods, all the way to generate dashboards and reports.

\subsection{Problem formulation}

How can a free, open-source web application be designed and validated to reproducibly consumption, process, analyze, and visualize YouTube data (covering engagement metrics, sentiment, topics, and interaction networks) in order to provide auditable insights for specified topics and periods?
