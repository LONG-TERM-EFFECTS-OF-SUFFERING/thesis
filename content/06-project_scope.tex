\section{Project Scope}

\subsection{Inclusions}

This section details the specific features, deliverables, and technologies that are part of the project.

\subsubsection{Functionality}

The project will deliver a fully functional web application that automates the collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of data from YouTube. The core functionalities include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data collection module: a configurable module will be implemented to collect video and associated comment data directly from the YouTube Data API v3 using specified query filters.

	\item Data Processing pipeline: the application will feature a processing pipeline designed to clean, normalize, validate, and structure the raw data retrieved from the API. This will transform the data into a standardized schema that links videos, comments, and replies.

	\item Presentation layer: a user-facing presentation layer will be built, featuring interactive dashboards and charts to visualize the analyzed data and key metrics.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technology}

The technical stack for the application is explicitly defined and will consist of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Backend service: the core application logic and API will be developed using the Django framework, with a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

	\item Frontend service: a lightweight Nginx web server will be used to serve the static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) from a React application build to the user's browser.

	\item Containerization: all services (Nginx, Django, PostgreSQL) will be containerized using Docker to ensure a consistent and reproducible deployment environment.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusions}

To maintain a clear focus and ensure the project is achievable within the defined timeframe, the following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Support for other platforms: data collection and analysis will be limited exclusively to YouTube. The application will not support any other social media or video platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, TikTok).

	\item Development of NLP models: while the project includes sentiment analysis, it will rely on existing, pre-trained models or established libraries. The scope does not include the research or development of new or custom natural language processing or machine learning models from scratch.

	\item Real-time data streaming: the data collection process is designed to be on-demand based on user queries. The project will not implement real-time or live-streaming data analysis.

	\item Native mobile application: the final deliverable is a web application accessible through standard desktop browsers. The development of native mobile applications for iOS or Android is not included.
\end{itemize}
