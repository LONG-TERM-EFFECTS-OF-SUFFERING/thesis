# Web application for automated collection, analysis, and visualization of YouTube data

## Abstract

YouTube, with 2,530 million monthly users, serves as a primary news source for 35% of U.S. adults. However, current YouTube analysis tools rely on proprietary, black-box methodologies that limit transparency and reproducibility, creating barriers for academic research requiring verifiable systems.

This thesis proposes to develop a web application to **process**, **analyze**, and **visualize** YouTube data using transparent and reproducible methods. The system comprises three integrated components: a data collection module using the YouTube Data API with natural language processing for query translation, a data processing pipeline for cleaning and normalizing responses, and an interactive visualization layer.

The methodology follows an adapted Scrum framework with iterative two-week sprints. Development includes technology stack selection, system architecture design, API integration with LLM-powered interfaces, database implementation, and comprehensive testing. All services are containerized using Docker for reproducible deployment.

The resulting application will provide a no-cost, transparent alternative to commercial tools, democratizing YouTube data analysis for academic researchers, non-profits, and independent investigators. By providing fully documented methodology and open architecture, this work promotes **reproducible science** and serves as a **foundational tool** for research in social media analysis, polarization, and information dissemination.
